    question: |
      Let $G$ be a finite group and $\pi$, $\pi'$ be two irreducible 
      representations of $G$. Prove or disprove the following assertion:
      $\pi$ and $\pi'$ are equivalent if and only if $\det\pi(g)=\det\pi'(g)$
      for all $g\in G$.

    question: |
      Let $R$ be a Noetherian ring. Prove that $R[x]$ and $R[[x]]$ are both
      Noetherian. (The first part of the question is asking you to prove the
      Hilbert Basis Theorem, not to use it!)

      Show that a finite simple group cannot have a 2-dimensional irreducible

    question: |
      Recall that an inner automorphism of a group is an automorphism given by conjugation by an element of the group. An outer automorphism is an automorphism that is not inner.
      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Prove that $S_5$ has a subgroup of order 20.
        \item Use the subgroup from (a) to construct a degree 6 permutation representation of $S_5$ (i.e., an embedding $S_5 \hookrightarrow S_6$ as a transitive permutation group on 6 letters).
        \item Conclude that $S_6$ has an outer automorphism.
      \end{enumerate}

    question: |
      Let $A$ be a commutative ring and $M$ a finitely generated $A$-module. Define
      \[ \Ann(M) = \{a \in A: am = 0 \text{ for all } m \in M\}.\]
      Show that for a prime ideal $\mathfrak p \subset A$, the following are equivalent:
      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
          \item $\Ann(M) \not\subset \mathfrak p$
          \item The localization of $M$ at the prime ideal $\mathfrak p$ is $0$.
          \item $M \otimes_A k(\mathfrak p) = 0$, where $k(\mathfrak p) = A_{\mathfrak p}/\mathfrak p A_{\mathfrak p}$ is the residue field of $A$ at $\mathfrak p$.
      \end{enumerate}

      Let $A = \C[x,y]/(y^2-(x-1)^3 - (x-1)^2)$.
      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Show that $A$ is an integral domain and sketch the $\R$-points of $\text{Spec} A$.
        \item Find the integral closure of $A$. Recall that for an integral domain $A$ with fraction field $K$, the integral closure of $A$ in $K$ is the set of all elements of $K$ integral over $A$.
      \end{enumerate}

      Let $R = k[x,y]$ where $k$ is a field, and let $I=(x,y)R$.

          \item Show that
          \[

          0 \ar[r] & R \arrow[r,"\phi"] & R \oplus R \arrow[r,"\psi"] & R \arrow[r] & k \arrow[r] & 0
          \end{tikzcd}
          \]
          where $\phi(a) = (-ya,xa)$, $\psi((a,b)) = xa+yb$ for $a,b \in R$, is a projective resolution of the $R$-module $k \simeq R/I$.
          \item Show that $I$ is not a flat $R$-module by computing $\Tor_i^R(I,k)$
      \end{enumerate}
