      Let $C_p$ denote the cyclic group of order $p$.
      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Show that $C_p$ has two irreducible representations over
          $\mathbb Q$ (up to isomorphism), one of dimension 1
          and one of dimension $p-1$.
        \item Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $\rho:G\rightarrow
          \GL_n(\mathbb Q)$ be a representation of $G$ over $\mathbb Q$.
          Let $\rho_{\mathbb C}:G\rightarrow\GL_n(\mathbb C)$ denote
          $\rho$ followed by the inclusion $\GL_n(\mathbb Q)\rightarrow
          \GL_n(\mathbb C)$. Thus $\rho_{\mathbb C}$ is a representation
          of $G$ over $\mathbb C$, called the \textit{complexification}
          of $\rho$. We say that an irreducible representation $\rho$
          of $G$ is \textit{absolutely irreducible} if its
          complexification remains irreducible over $\mathbb C$.\\

          of $G$ over $\mathbb Q$ is absolutely irreducible. Show that
          $G\cong(C_2)^k$ for some $k$ (i.e., is a product of
          cyclic groups of order 2).

      $C\subseteq G$, let $P_C=\sum_{g\in C}g$.
      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Show that the elements $P_C$ form a $\mathbb Z$-basis for
          $\mathcal Z$. Hence $\mathcal Z\cong\mathbb Z^d$ as an
          abelian group, where $d$ is the number of
          conjugacy classes in $G$.
        \item Show that if a ring $R$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z^d$ as
          an abelian group, then every element in $R$ satisfies
          a monic integral polynomial.
          (\textbf{Hint:} Let $\{v_1,\dots,v_d\}$ be a basis of
          $R$ and for a fixed non-zero $r\in R$, write $rv_i=\sum_j
          a_{ij}v_j$. Use the Hamilton-Cayley theorem.)
        \item Let $\pi:G\rightarrow\GL(V)$ be an irreducible representation
          of $G$ (over $\mathbb C$). Show that $\pi(P_C)$ acts on $V$
          as multiplication by the scalar
          $$
          \frac{|C|\chi_{\pi}(C)}{\dim V},

          where $\chi_{\pi}(C)$ is the value of the character
          $\chi_{\pi}$ on any element of $C$.

          integer.

      it must be isomorphic to $A_5$.

      Let $R$ be a commutative ring. Recall that an element $r$ of $R$ is
      \textit{nilpotent} if $r^n=0$ for some positive integer $n$ and that

      elements.

          $$
          N(R)=\cap_{P\text{ prime}}P.

          wish to construct a prime ideal that does not
          contain $r$ or its powers.)

          decomposition of its regular representation as a direct
          sum of irreducible representations.

          representation is reducible; that is, there is
