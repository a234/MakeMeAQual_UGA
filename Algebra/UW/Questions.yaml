    question: |
      Let $R$ be a Noetherian ring. Prove that $R[x]$ and $R[[x]]$ are both
      Noetherian. (The first part of the question is asking you to prove the
      Hilbert Basis Theorem, not to use it!)

    question: |
      Recall that an inner automorphism of a group is an automorphism given by conjugation by an element of the group. An outer automorphism is an automorphism that is not inner.
      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Prove that $S_5$ has a subgroup of order 20.
        \item Use the subgroup from (a) to construct a degree 6 permutation representation of $S_5$ (i.e., an embedding $S_5 \hookrightarrow S_6$ as a transitive permutation group on 6 letters).
        \item Conclude that $S_6$ has an outer automorphism.
      \end{enumerate}

      \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \item Let $L$ be a Galois extension of a field $K$ of degree 4.
          What is the minimum number of subfields there could
          be strictly between $K$ and $L$? What is the maximum
          number of such subfields? Give examples where these
          bounds are attained.
        \item How do these numbers change if we assume only that $L$
          is separable (but not necessarily Galois) over $K$?

      Let $R$ be a commutative algebra over $\mathbb C$. A derivation of $R$ is a
      $\mathbb C$-linear map $D:R\rightarrow R$ such that (i) $D(1)=0$ and

          of $\mathbb C[x]$ and the left multiplications by $x$.
          Prove that $\mathbb C[x]$ is a simple left $A$-module.
          Note that the inclusion $A\rightarrow\End_{\mathbb C}(\mathbb C[x])$
          defines a natural left $A$-module structure on $\mathbb C[x]$.
