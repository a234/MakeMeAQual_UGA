# Question 5

Let $G$ be a finite abelian group. Let $f:\mathbb Z^m\rightarrow G$ be a
surjection of abelian groups. We may think of $f$ as a homomorphism
of $\mathbb Z$-modules. Let $K$ be the kernel of $f$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Prove that $K$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb Z^m$.
  \item We can therefore write the inclusion map
    $K\rightarrow\mathbb Z^m$ as $\mathbb Z^m\rightarrow\mathbb Z^m$
    and represent it by an $m\times m$ integer matrix
    $A$. Prove that $|\det A|=|G|$.
\end{enumerate}
