  question: |
    Describe the process that extends a measure on an algebra
    $\mathcal{A}$ of subsets of $X$, to a complete measure defined on a
    $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}$ containing $\mathcal{A}$. State the
    corresponding definitions and results (without proofs).

    1.  State the Dominated Convergence Theorem for Lebesgue integrals.

    2.  Let $\{f_n\}$ be a sequence of measurable functions on a
        Lebesgue measurable set $E$ which converges *in measure* to a
        function $f$ on $E$. Suppose that for every $n$, $|f_n| \leq g$
        with $g$ integrable on $E$. Using the above theorem show that
        \begin{align*}
            \int_E |f_n-f| \longrightarrow 0 \, .
        \end{align*}

    - Absolute Continuity
  question: |
    Let $f$ be a continuous function on $[0,1]$. Show that the following
    statements are equivalent.

    1.  $f$ is absolutely continuous.

    2.  For any $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ such that
        $m(f(E)) < \epsilon$ for any set $E\subseteq [0,1]$ with
        $m(E) < \delta$.

    3.  $m(f(E)) = 0$ for any set $E \subseteq [0,1]$ with $m(E)=0$.
