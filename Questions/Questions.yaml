  question: |
    Let $G$ be a finite group of order $p^nm$ where $p$ is a prime and
    $m$ is not divisible by $p$. Prove that if $H$ is a subgroup of $G$
    of order $p^k$ for some $k<n$, then the normalizer of $H$ in $G$
    properly contains $H$.

    Let $H$ be a subgroup of $S_n$ of index $n$. Prove:

    1.  There is an isomorphism $f: S_n \to S_n$ such that $f(H)$ is the
        subgroup of $S_n$ stabilizing $n$. In particular, $H$ is
        isomorphic to $S_{n-1}$.

    2.  The only subgroups of $S_n$ containing $H$ are $S_n$ and $H$.

        $n \geq 1$, has non-trivial center.

    3.  Prove that a group of order $p^2$ must be abelian.

    Let $G$ be a finite group.

    1.  Prove that if $H < G$ is a proper subgroup, then $G$ is not the
        union of conjugates of $H$.

    2.  Suppose that $G$ acts transitively on a set $X$ with $|X| > 1$.
        Prove that there exists an element of $G$ with no fixed points
        in $X$.
