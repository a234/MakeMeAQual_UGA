    Assume that $K$ is a cyclic group, $H$ is an arbitrary group, and $\varphi_1$
    and $\varphi_2$ are homomorphisms from $K$ into $\Aut(H)$ such that
    $\varphi_1(K)$ and $\varphi_2(K)$ are conjugate subgroups
    of $\Aut(H)$.

    Prove by constructing an explicit isomorphism that
    $H\rtimes_{\varphi_1}K\cong H\rtimes_{\varphi_2} K$.

    > Suppose $\sigma_{\varphi_1}(K)\sigma\inv=\varphi_2(K)$
    so that for some $a\in\mathbb Z$ we have $\sigma\varphi_1(k)\sigma\inv
    =\varphi_2(k)^a$ for all $k\in K$. Show that the map $\psi:H
    \rtimes_{\varphi_1}K\rightarrow H\rtimes_{\varphi_2}K$
    defined by $\psi((h,k))=(\sigma(h),k^a)$ is a homomorphism.
    Show $\psi$ is bijective by construcing a 2-sided inverse.
